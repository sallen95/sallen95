### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Scott. I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for creating beautiful applications and using those applications to enhance peoples' lives. I enjoy spending my free time with my wife in the beautiful Utah mountains whether that be hiking and camping in the summer or snowshoeing and skiing in the winter.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Vue.
I have experience in Node.js, Java, Python, and Firestore.
